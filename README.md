# README Project Application

#Description
For this challenge the goal was creating a README Generator that used the CLI (command line interface.)  We have used README files in every other challenge so it is essential that I hone my skills to not only create consistent professional looking READMEs but also learn how to create an application that can be used by anyone as a guideline for a professional README file.  
#Installation

#Contributing
I installed version 8.2.4 of node to facilitate the questions asked when the generator process begins.  I began with the starter code and was helped by my instructor Leif Hetland, the TA Fred Kamm, my classmates, and my tutor Erik Hoversten.
